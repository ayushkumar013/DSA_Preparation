//Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.
//Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        int a=0,b=0;
        Arrays.sort(g);
         Arrays.sort(s);
        while(a<g.length && b<s.length){
            if(g[a]<=s[b]) a++;
            b++;
        }
        return a;
    }
}         //time complexity- (nlogn),  space complexity- (1)
