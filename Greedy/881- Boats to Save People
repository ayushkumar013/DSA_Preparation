//You are given an array people where people[i] is the weight of the ith person, and an infinite number of boats where each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.
//Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.
// Example 1:
//      Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
//      Output: 1
