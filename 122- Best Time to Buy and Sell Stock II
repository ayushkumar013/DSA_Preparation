//You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
//On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.
//Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.
// Example 1:
//             Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
//             Output: 7
